# ResearchProject

By estimating Parkinson's in a person, it can help to predict the disease earlier. This project makes use of different machine learning models in order to determine the best model used when accessing the parkinsons dataset, and seeing which one is the best at predicting the total_UPDRS, which is the UPDRS score which indicates their likeliness of parkinsons disease
